Deep Learning Model for CIFAR-10 Classification

This project implements a deep learning pipeline for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, a baseline CNN model, hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, and an advanced Wide & Deep model.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Normalization and one-hot encoding.

Baseline CNN Model: A simple convolutional neural network.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of CNN architecture using Keras Tuner.

Wide & Deep Model: A hybrid architecture combining wide and deep pathways.

Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC for model comparison.

Results:

The models are evaluated on accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC across training, validation, and test datasets.

Models Implemented:

Basic CNN Model

Hyperparameter-Tuned CNN Model

Wide & Deep Model

Dataset:

CIFAR-10: 60,000 images in 10 classes (airplane, car, bird, etc.).
